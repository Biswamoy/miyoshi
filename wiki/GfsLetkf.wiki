== Prepare required executables and libraries ==

Our LETKF package provides the LETKF assimilation code coupled to the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecasting System (GFS) model. It requires several executables and libraries from the NCEP, which mainly belong to two NCEP models, GFS and Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI). Compiling these libraries and models on your computer may not be easy and may take long time.

 * *GFS*: The GFS model is an operational global NWP model developed by the Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) at the NCEP. It is one of the major state-of-the-art operational NWP models over the world and provides main model guidance for the weather forecast in the United States. It is not a community model, and some of the code may not be open to public, so users interested to run the GFS-LETKF system need to contact NCEP to obtain the GFS model code and the associated libraries.
  * NCEP/EMC GFS model page: [http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/index.php?branch=GFS]
  * When you compile the GFS model, you may need to compile the [http://www.earthsystemmodeling.org/ Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)] first.

 * *GSI*: The GSI is the primary data assimilation system for the GFS model, based on 3-dimensional variational method (3DVar). In our GFS-LETKF implementation, there is an option to use the GSI as an observation operator. Note that we only use the GSI as the observation operator, and the GSI 3DVar solution is not computed in the GFS-LETKF. Besides, if you are not going to assimilate the satellite radiance data, in the GFS-LETKF package there is also a set of built-in observation operators that does not rely on the GSI. In this case, you do not need to install the GSI.
  * The GSI has been a community model, available at [http://www.dtcenter.org/com-GSI/users/]

=== List of required executables and libraries ===

 * *NCEP executables*:
 After successfully compiling the GFS and GSI, you are asked to put all executable files together in the '{{{$EXECGLOBAL}}}' directory configured in '{{{gfs/run/configure.sh}}}'.
|| *Name* || *Purpose* || *Called from* ||
|| {{{global_fcst}}} || GFS main program || {{{gfs/run/run_gfs.sh}}}<br>{{{gfs/run/cycle.sh}}}<br>{{{gfs/run/fcst.sh}}} ||
|| {{{global_gsi}}} || GSI main program || {{{gfs/run/run_gsi.sh}}}<br>{{{gfs/run/cycle.sh}}} ||

|| {{{global_sfchdr}}} || Read the header of the GFS surface input/output files || {{{gfs/run/run_gfs.sh}}}<br>{{{gfs/run/run_gsi.sh}}} ||
|| {{{global_chgres}}} || Change the resolution of the GFS input/output files || {{{gfs/run/run_chgres.sh}}} ||

 * *NCEP libraries required for compiling the GFS-LETKF code*:
 These libraries are required for compiling several programs in the GFS-LETKF package. The path of these libraries are configured in '{{{gfs/configure.user}}}' :
|| *Name* || *Purpose* || *List of files required* || *Link* ||
|| {{{bacio}}} || Basic I/O library for the GFS || {{{$(BACIO_LIB)/libbacio_4.a}}} ||  ||
|| {{{sigio}}} || I/O library for the GFS sigma-level files || {{{$(SIGIO_LIB)/libsigio_4.a}}}<br>{{{$(SIGIO_INC)/sigio_module.mod}}}<br>{{{$(SIGIO_INC)/sigio_r_module.mod}}} ||  ||
|| {{{sfcio}}} || I/O library for the GFS surface-level files || {{{$(SFCIO_LIB)/libsfcio_4.a}}}<br>{{{$(SFCIO_INC)/sfcio_module.mod}}} ||  ||

|| {{{bufrlib}}} || I/O library for the BUFR file format || {{{$(BUFR_LIB)/libbufrlib.a}}} || [http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/sib/decoders/BUFRLIB/] ||

 * *Other NCEP libraries that may be required for compiling the GFS and GSI*:
 These libraries may be required when you compile the GFS and GSI, but they are NOT directly required in the GFS-LETKF code.
|| *Name* || *Purpose* ||
|| {{{ip}}} || General interpolation library ||
|| {{{landsfcutil}}} || Land surface library ||
|| {{{gfsio}}} || GFS I/O library ||
|| {{{nemsio}}} || NEMS I/O library ||
|| {{{w3lib}}} || I/O library for the GRIB file format ||

 * *Other required libraries*:
 LAPACK may be required when it is not provided by the Fortran compiler. For example, if you use the Intel Fortran compiler with its Math Kernel Library (MKL), the LAPACK is included and you do not need to install LAPACK by yourself.
|| *Name* || *Purpose* || *Link* ||
|| {{{LAPACK}}} || Linear algebra package || [http://www.netlib.org/lapack/] ||

== Prepare fix files for the GFS and GSI ==

To run the GFS and GSI, they require several "fix" data files (e.g., boundary conditions) and CRTM coefficients. These files need to be put in three directories: '{{{$FIXGLOBAL}}}', '{{{$FIXGSI}}}', and '{{{$FIXCRTM}}}', configured in '{{{gfs/run/configure.sh}}}'.

The GFS fix files can be found at [http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/codes/nwprod/fix/] , but they are much more than enough to drive a GFS model. It is recommended to select only the necessary files when putting into '{{{$FIXGLOBAL}}}'.

== Test compiling the GFS-LETKF programs ==

When the required libraries are ready, we can do a test compilation of all GFS-LETKF programs.

 * Go to the gfs main directory:
{{{
$ cd gfs
}}}
 * Edit the '{{{configure.user}}}' file, specify the compiler flags and paths of the required libraries in your system. In the '{{{arch}}}' directory, there are a few examples of the '{{{configure.user}}}' file using the PGI or Intel compilers.
 * Compile all GFS-LETKF programs.
{{{
$ make
}}}

If the compilation is successful, you will obtain a number of executable files listed below:
|| *File path and name* || *Purpose* ||
|| {{{common/datetime}}} || A utility for date and time computation ||
|| {{{common/enssize}}} || To simply print the ensemble size ||
|| {{{letkf/efsoXXX}}} || EFSO mean program ||
|| {{{letkf/letkfXXX}}} || LETKF main program ||
|| {{{letkf/meanXXX}}} || To compute the ensemble mean from grid files ||

|| {{{obs/dec_prepbufr}}} || To convert the NCEP PREPBUFR data to the LETKF observation format ||
|| {{{readdiag_conv}}} || To convert the GSI diagnostic files to the LETKF observation format with model background values ||
|| {{{obs/superob}}} || A superobing/thinning utility ||
|| {{{ssio/grd2ss}}} || To convert a grid file to GFS sig/sfc (spectral) files, and also cycle forecasts into analyses ||
|| {{{ssio/grdctl}}} || To print GrADS ctl files according to the current grid settings ||
|| {{{ssio/ss2grd}}} || To convert GFS sig/sfc (spectral) files to a grid file ||
|| {{{ssio/ss2grdp}}} || To convert GFS sig/sfc (spectral) files to a grid file in pressure coordinates ||

== Main configuration script ==

The '{{{configure.sh}}}' is the main configuration file. The other scripts are run based on this configuration file. The explanation of all the configurable variables are provided along with the file (using code comments). Selected variables are explained here:

|| *Variable* || *Description* ||
|| {{{OUTDIR}}} || GFS-LETKF input and output directory. ||
|| {{{SYSNAME}}} || A unique name in the machine, which is used to identify multiple GFS-LETKF runs. ||
|| {{{LTMP1}}}<br>{{{LTMP2}}} || Level 1 and 2 local temporary directories on computing nodes. They are only used when {{{$SHAREDISK = 0}}}. They must exist on all computing nodes. The capacity requirement of the level 1 temporary directory is not too big but the I/O speed is very important; therefore, a RAMdisk ({{{/dev/shm}}} in Linux machines) could be assigned to this variable if the memory on your machine is sufficient. The capacity requirement of the level 2 temporary directory is bigger than {{{$LTMP1}}} and the I/O speed is less important than {{{$LTMP1}}}. The {{{$LTMP1}}} and the {{{$LTMP2}}} can be assigned to the same directory if you do not want to separate the location of different temporary files. ||
|| {{{TMP1}}} || Temporary directory on the server machine. Accessing to this directory from other computing nodes is not required. ||
|| {{{TMPMPI}}} || Temporary directory on the server machine with shared access from all computing nodes. ||
|| {{{SHAREDISK}}} || Do we use local disks on computing nodes to store runtime temporary file?<br>0: Yes, use local disks ({{{$LTMP1}}}, {{{$LTMP2}}}) to store temporary files.<br>1: No, the {{{$OUTDIR}}} is a shared disk that can be accessed from all computing nodes. Use this shared disk to store temporary files.||
|| {{{EXECGLOBAL}}} || Directory of the NCEP executable files (GFS, GSI... etc.). ||

The verification results against model data in {{{$ANLGRDP}}} will be stored in '{{{$OUTDIR/verfa1}}}'; the verification results against model data in {{{$ANLGRDP2}}} will be stored in '{{{$OUTDIR/verfa2}}}'. ||
|| {{{INITGFS}}} || Directory of arbitrary initial condition files in the GFS sig/sfc formats. It can be the same as {{{$ANLGFS}}} if the quality of the reference model data in that directory is good. See explanation at [XXX] ||
|| {{{OBS}}} || Directory of observation data in the LETKF observation format, required when using the built-in observation operator ({{{$OBSOPE_OPT = 1}}}). ||
|| {{{OBSNCEP}}} || Directory of observation data in the NCEP BUFR format, required when using GSI as the observation operator ({{{$OBSOPE_OPT = 2}}}). ||

|| {{{THIN_OPT}}} || Superobing/thinning options:<br>-- Options below (1-2) is for {{{$OBSOPE_OPT = 1}}}<br>1: No superobing/thinning.<br>2: Use superobed/thinned observations processed by the '{{{gfs/obs/superob}}}' program before the LETKF assimilation.<br>-- Options below (3-4) are for {{{$OBSOPE_OPT = 2}}}<br>3: use thinned observations for satellite radiance observations only, processed by the GSI.<br>4: use thinned observations for both conventional and satellite radiance observations, processed by the GSI. ||
|| {{{ADAPTINFL}}} || Adaptive inflation options:<br>0: OFF, no adaptive inflation.<br>1: ON, using inflation parameter 1 cycle ago as the prior.<br>2: ON, using inflation parameter 2 cycles ago as the prior (leap-frog the adaptive inflation fields). ||
