== SPEEDY model ==
  * SPEEDY is a simplified AGCM (Atmospheric General Circulation Model) developed by [http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-002-0268-2 Molteni (2003)]. It has only 96x48x7 grid points for Earth's global atmosphere. It is feasible for single processor PC (like your desktop or laptop PC) with a Fortran 90 compiler and shell scripting environment. I have tested with a Linux PC with Intel Celeron D 2.16 GHz processor (about 5 years old), as well as very recent Intel Xeon quad-core 2.5 GHz processors. It takes about 2 seconds for 6-hr forecast with the Celeron D processor, and about 0.4 seconds with the Xeon processor (single process).
