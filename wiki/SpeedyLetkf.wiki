== SPEEDY model ==
  * SPEEDY is a simplified AGCM (Atmospheric General Circulation Model) developed by [http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-002-0268-2 Molteni (2003)]. It has only 96x48x7 grid points for Earth's global atmosphere. It is feasible for single processor PC (like your desktop or laptop PC) with a Fortran 90 compiler and shell scripting environment. I have tested with a Linux PC with Intel Celeron D 2.16 GHz processor (about 5 years old), as well as very recent Intel Xeon quad-core 2.5 GHz processors. It takes about 2 seconds for 6-hr forecast with the Celeron D processor, and about 0.4 seconds with the Xeon processor (single process).
  * [http://users.ictp.it/~moltenif/index.html Franco Molteni] and [http://users.ictp.it/~kucharsk/ Fred Kucharski] should be acknowledged for the use of SPEEDY model.

== Getting started ==
  # Download the latest release version from the [http://code.google.com/p/miyoshi/source/checkout Source tab].
  # Run the SPEEDY model
    # Dig into the model directory
{{{
$cd speedy/model/run
}}}
    # Execute run_first.sh
{{{
$sh run_first.sh
}}}
    This executes 1-year integration. It may take time according to your computer. With an Intel Xeon 2.5GHz Quad-core processor, it takes about 6 min with a single process (without making use of multi-core function).
    # Edit and execute run_cycle.sh<br>Edit the final date setting for your convenience. Just for testing, one day may be sufficient.
{{{
$sh run_cycle.sh
}}}
    # At this point, you already got the "nature run" of the SPEEDY model. You can visualize the data using [http://www.iges.org/grads/ GrADS software].
{{{
$cd ../DATA
$grads
ga-> open nature/yyyymmddhh.ctl
}}}
  # Generate simulated observation data
    # Change directory to the observation tools directory
{{{
$cd ../obs
}}}
    # Compile the program
{{{
$sh make_obsmake.sh
}}}
    # Edit and execute obsmake.sh<br>Edit the final date setting shorter than the one that you generated the nature run.
{{{
$sh obsmake.sh
}}}
  # Run the SPEEDY-LETKF forecast/assimilation cycle experiment
  # Monitor the standard output
